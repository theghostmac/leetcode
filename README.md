## Linked List Problems

Easy:

Remove Duplicates from Sorted List: Given a sorted linked list, remove all duplicates such that each element appears only once.
Merge Two Sorted Lists: Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
Palindrome Linked List: Determine if a given linked list is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
Medium:

Reverse Linked List: Reverse a singly linked list in-place.
Detect Cycle in a Linked List: Determine if a linked list contains a cycle.
Middle of the Linked List: Find the middle node of a singly linked list.
Linked List Cycle II: Find the node where a cycle begins in a linked list.
Reorder List: Given a singly linked list, rearrange the nodes in such a way that the first half of the list is reversed, and the second half remains as it is.
